# Flutter Template

To spin off a new project, write this prompt with thinking on (replacing new_project_name and prefix with your desired names):

This is currently a template. I want to spin off a new project named Grouseries. Create a new
firebase project with firebase mcp named {new_project_name} (or {prefix}-{new_project_name} grouseries if that name is not available). Update any files with the new name and remove any referencies to the flutter-template
firebase project.

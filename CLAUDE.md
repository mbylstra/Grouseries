# Flutter Project Rules

## Flutter/Dart Development

- Never manually edit pubspec.yaml to add dependencies
- Always use `dart pub add` or `flutter pub add` to install packages

## Quality Checks

- After completing any prompt, always run `flutter analyze` to check for type errors and other issues
- After completing any prompt, always run `make format` to format code
